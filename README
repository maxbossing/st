st - simple terminal
--------------------
My personal configuration of the st Terminal emulator.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
To use this configuration without changes, install the FiraCode Medium Font

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
